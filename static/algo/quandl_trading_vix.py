# Trading VIX - Quandl Data Now In Pipeline For Backtesting And Live Trading
# James Christopher, 2015
#####################################################################
# Below is an implementation using VIX Term Structure Following, to determine entry and exit points for
# trading the volatility ETFs VXX (S&P 500 short term futures) and XIV (inverse S&P 500 short term futures).
